## Bidding for ACF Fall and Regionals
If you would like to host an ACF tournament in your region, email the [Mirror Coordinator](mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com).

### Regions according to ACF
For the purposes of selecting ACF tournament sites only, ACF generally considers North America to contain these regions:

Ideally, every tournament will have one host in each of those regions. However, actual sites may differ slightly, based on increased or decreased interest, or if the best hosts are at opposite ends of adjacent regions. ACF recognizes that state and provincial borders do not capture the full complexity of regional circuits, and may place tournament sites slightly differently than the regions above. Teams are permitted to attend whichever site is most convenient for them.
When the Mirror Coordinator receives more than one host bid from a given region, they will choose the host based primarily on a combination of two factors: who they expect to attract more teams, and who they expect to run the best tournament based on past hosting performance and present staffing and resource capabilities.

## Host requirements
### Finances
*Fees:* Hosts must use the posted fee schedule for ACF tournaments. However, hosts may provide additional discounts, provided that they are subtracted from the amount of money the host receives and not the amount that ACF receives (see [Financial breakdown between hosts and ACF](#financial-breakdown-between-hosts-and-acf)). Hosts are responsible for invoicing each team that has registered for their site. Hosts will have access to a spreadsheet of teams attending their site, and should invoice each team as soon as possible after the team registers. Hosts are required to use payment tracker spreadsheets, which will be provided by the Treasurer, to track how much each team owes, which teams they have invoiced and when, and to indicate which teams have paid. Hosts must communicate with the Treasurer if they need to make changes to e.g. buzzer and staffer discounts.

*Currency:* Sites in countries that do not use the United States Dollar must work out an appropriate payment structure with the Mirror Coordinator and Treasurer.

*Payment:* See [Payment from Hosts to ACF](#payment-from-hosts-to-acf).
### Mirror announcements
*Announcements:* The editors will endeavor to finalize the host bids ten weeks before the tournament, at which time all hosts should put out their announcements. Hosts must announce their tournament to the [Quizbowl Resource Center Forums](http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=8), add their tournament to the [Quizbowl Resource Center Database](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/), and contact local teams in a timely fashion. If the host team or region maintains a social media presence, they are also encouraged to advertise their tournament via social media.
The title of announcement should be in the form of “[Year] ACF [Tournament] at [Site].” The announcement should explicitly state, at a minimum, the date and day of the week of the tournament (which will normally be Saturday, but can be Sunday in some cases); instructions on how to register; and the link to official ACF information on packet submission.
### Tournament format and rules
*Rules:* Hosts must use the [official ACF rules](/gameplay-rules) for gameplay.

*Format:* All teams must be offered at least 9 meaningful games for Fall, and 10 meaningful games for Regionals. (Exceptions must be approved by the Mirror Coordinator.) ACF recommends offering at least 11 games. More details on suggested formats and tiebreaking procedures can be found on ACF’s [Formats](/formats/) page. Hosts should expect that at least 15 packets will be available for Fall and Regionals.
For ACF Regionals, tournament formats must be approved by the Mirror Coordinator one week before the tournament.
### Tournament results
*Statistics:* Hosts must keep statistics for the entire tournament using SQBS, fully and accurately entering all team, individual, and packet statistics that the program uses (remember to enable “round reports”). Within 24 hours of the conclusion of the tournament, hosts must publicly post all SQBS reports to the Quizbowl Resource Center Database. They must also post a link to the statistics report and a brief summary of the results and top scorer on their announcement thread on the Quizbowl Resource Center Forums. If a tournament uses multiple phases, hosts must post reports for the preliminary phase, the playoff phase, and both phases combined. Host should make every effort to make any corrections to their statistics and re-upload the SQBS report within 24 hours of receiving corrections. Hosts may use a different program during the tournament itself and redo the statistics in SQBS. SQBS is available for free [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~csewell/sqbs/). A guide on ACF’s best practices for submitting SQBS reports is [here](/sqbs-guide). Failing to keep statistics, post or correct statistics in a timely manner, or follow ACF’s best practices may result in a penalty (see [Penalties](#penalties-for-egregious-hosting-violations)).

*Detailed Statistics:* Some tournaments will require hosts to keep detailed statistics. Hosts will be responsible for ensuring that each staffer has been trained on using online scoresheets and best practices before the tournament. The Mirror Coordinator will work with the host site to provide adequate training resources well in advance of the tournament. On the day of the tournament, the host will be responsible for each staffer having a working laptop that can connect to the internet. Keeping detailed statistics is a substitute for conventional scoresheets and packets, but not for compiling SQBS reports and submitting them to the Quizbowl Resource Center Database.

*Trophies:* Hosts must provide the appropriate trophies and prizes to teams, as described below. The cost of trophies and prizes, and other tournament expenses, is borne entirely by the hosts and does not affect the calculation of the editors’ share of the entry fees. ACF will provide trophies to hosts at reasonable cost. ACF will pay the trophy provider directly (including shipping to the host site) and the cost will come out of the host site’s share. If a host would like ACF to provide trophies for their site, they should contact the Mirror Coordinator at least two weeks before the tournament. 
The top two overall teams will receive trophies in all cases. If, two weeks before the tournament, the host reasonably expects fewer than four Division II teams (at any tournament) and/or four Undergraduate teams (at Regionals and Nationals) will play the tournament, when the trophies are ordered, then the host must inform ACF that it will opt out of Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies. If the host opts out of Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies, but it turns out that there are enough teams to award either or both of those titles, the host must make reasonable efforts to award prizes to the winners. If there are four or more teams that are expected to play the tournament, the Undergraduate and/or Division II titles must be awarded; failing to do so will incur a penalty (see [Penalties](#penalties-for-egregious-hosting-violations)).

*Book Prizes:* At a minimum, the members of the top two overall teams, and the top four individual scorers, should receive book prizes. Inexpensive used books are perfectly acceptable. For tournaments with more than ten teams, it is preferred that at least the fifth through eighth overall scorers also received book prizes. If the field composition merits awarding Division II and/or Undergraduate Trophies (see above for trophy information), the top four Division II scorers (at any tournament) and/or four Undergraduate scorers (at Regionals and Nationals) should also receive book prizes. 
In addition to awarding individual book prizes as specified, hosts of tournaments using detailed statistics may optionally choose to recognize the top scorers in each category (e.g. literature, science, history, fine arts, religion/mythology/philosophy, etc.). Hosts may purchase extra books for this purpose, or may announce the top scorers in each category without awarding extra prizes.

*Qualifying for ACF Nationals:* ACF Regionals serves as a qualifying tournament for ACF Nationals. ACF’s procedures for determining which teams have qualified for ACF Nationals are available [here](/nationals-qualification/). As with any ACF tournament, failing to play off or award any applicable Undergraduate and Division II titles at Regionals will incur a penalty (see [Penalties](#penalties-for-egregious-hosting-violations)). In the event that a host’s failure to play off or award Undergraduate and Division II titles precludes awarding Nationals bids normally, ACF will handle bids on a case-by-case basis.
### Miscellaneous
*Recordings:* Teams registering for ACF tournaments will be asked to sign a media waiver. Hosts are welcome to record games at ACF tournaments, if that game’s players and staffers all consent before the game, and consent is not revoked during or after the game. ACF asks that hosts refrain from livestreaming games (including final games), or uploading recorded matches until 24 hours after the last mirror has concluded, to avoid question content being revealed to other sites.

*Environmental Impact:* ACF encourages all hosts to run their tournaments digitally in order to be environmentally responsible and save on the time and cost of copying paper packets and scoresheets.

Hosts do not owe ACF any money for teams receiving the “new quizbowl team discount.” Any money they do pay is the host’s. Normally, such teams will pay around $50. ACF asks for the cooperation of tournament directors in welcoming new teams into quizbowl by taking significantly less money from such teams.
Host teams (also called “house teams”) do not owe ACF anything and are not required to write packets. However, they have the option of writing a packet for the host team to save money. If the host team (or any combination of the host team and host-provided staff) writes an acceptable packet by the no-penalty deadline, then they will receive a $50 discount from the total amount that they owe to ACF.
ACF does not expect hosts to lose money by allowing a team into their tournament. In the unlikely event that a strict reading of these guidelines implies that the hosts owe ACF more money for a particular team than that team actually is supposed to pay the hosts, then the amount the hosts owe ACF will be adjusted downwards.
### Financial viability
Based on past tournaments, hosts can expect the average ACF event to attract 8 to 12 teams and bring in a gross amount of $1500. Hosts should expect to spend about $200 on prizes and other logistical costs of your tournament.
Of the remaining $1300, hosts should expect $650 to go to the editors, and about $650 in profit. Obviously, these numbers can vary significantly in any direction depending on the circumstances of the host’s particular tournament, but generally hosts have found hosting ACF events to be a positive contribution to quizbowl as well as a good way to raise money for their own tournament-attendance schedule.
### Payment from Hosts to ACF
ACF uses a host payment system, in which hosts should collect payment from teams, and ACF will collect fees from the hosts.
After host sites are confirmed, the treasurer will contact each host to provide ACF’s payment information, and to identify any possible stumbling blocks in the payment process (such as vendor or other tax forms that must be filled out, etc.).
Hosts are responsible for invoicing teams attending their site promptly after they register (see fees above).
ACF will make every effort to bill hosts for the cost of their tournament within 1 week of the event. Hosts should remit payment to ACF within 8 weeks after their tournament is run. If payment is not remitted within 8 weeks, ACF may assess a $50 penalty fee (see [Penalties](#penalties-for-egregious-hosting-violations)). 
## Bidding for ACF Nationals
The bidding process for ACF Nationals occurs over the summer immediately following the previous ACF Nationals. ACF’s goal is to announce a site no later than September 15, so that teams may have the entire academic year to plan their trips before Nationals occurs in April. The primary factors in choosing a Nationals site include the need to rotate the tournament to different areas of the country over time, and the need to staff a tournament of 40 or more teams.
For ACF Nationals, the host school will receive $25 per team in attendance for use of the rooms, $15 per staffer provided, and the right to enter one host team for free. If the host team would normally be required to write a packet, then they must do so by the no-penalty deadline. Additional host teams will also be free, but will be allowed only if the tournament has adequate staff, and still must write packets by the no-penalty deadline if required to do so under the packet guidelines.
If ACF Nationals is officially designated as being “co-hosted” by multiple teams, then the other teams, besides the one at whose school the tournament is physically occurring, will also receive $15 per staffer provided.
The rest of the entry fees for ACF Nationals goes to the editors. ACF will provide staff meals, and cover other normal tournament expenses such as printing.

At the treasurer or head editor’s discretion, first-time violations may result in a warning instead of a monetary penalty.
Hosts should talk to the head editor of the tournament, or the ACF treasurer, to bring up any potential issues with the above penalties before they arise. The editor/treasurer may exempt hosts from requirements if it benefits the site.
## Safety and misconduct
ACF’s mission is to provide the best possible experience for players, coaches, and staff. Therefore, issues of safety and misconduct must be dealt with fairly and promptly.
ACF strongly recommends that hosts explicitly designate one or more individuals to whom players, coaches, or staff can confidentially address any concerns about safety and misconduct during the tournament, and make the process for doing so clear at the opening meeting. (The designated person or people could simply be the tournament director(s), though ACF recommends having one male and one female person in the role.)
Hosts should, of course, be familiar with the official [ACF rules](/gameplay-rules/), but they should pay particular attention to Section I, “Ethics and Conduct.” In particular, note that “the use of malicious or disrespectful language toward another participant in the match, or the use of epithets insulting a participant’s race, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, etc.” constitutes misconduct, for which you are empowered to eject players from a match. If you encounter a case of misconduct serious enough that ACF should be made aware of it (if, for example, there are indications of a pattern of behavior that might be repeated at other tournaments), you may wish to let the victim know they can fill out the [Misconduct Reporting Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfndx3DUXgSwpzpweSRLxkErgPlQg4XATE2UaQDJ3EpbpCMPQ/viewform), and/or you can fill it out yourself. Questions or concerns about misconduct can also be addressed to Alex Damisch (alexandra.damisch@gmail.com) or Rob Carson (rob.f.carson@gmail.com).
