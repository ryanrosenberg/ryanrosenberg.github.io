## ACF Regionals 2020
ACF Regionals 2020 will be held on **January 25th, 2020**. JinAh Kim, alumna of the University of Pennsylvania, will be head editor.

## Apply to edit
Breaking from tradition, the subject editors for this yearâ€™s ACF Regionals will be selected via an open application process. Our hope is that instituting a formal application process for Regionals will bring in a combination of both highly experienced and rising editors.

The application to edit ACF Regionals 2020 is now closed. Editors will be chosen and announced publicly shortly.

## Apply to host
ACF will be soliciting host bids for ACF Regionals over the summer and fall. For any questions, please contact [the ACF Mirror Coordinator](mailto:hosting@acf-quizbowl.com).
