Medium-difficulty tournaments are designed to be played by competitors of all skill levels.

Medium tournaments aim to be accessible to new players with tossup answers and easy/medium bonus part answers that would not be out of place at ACF Fall. They also seek to challenge even very experienced players through interesting leadins and hard parts to bonuses. This is a tricky balance to maintain, but several sets, most notably several iterations of the Early Fall Tournament, fit the medium difficulty category well. Note that while the rebooted ACF Winter coming back in 2020-21 is intended to be at medium difficulty, the previous editions of ACF Winter were not -- they ended up being something more like regional difficulty in modern parlance.
