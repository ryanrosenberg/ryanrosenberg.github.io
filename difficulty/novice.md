Novice tournaments are designed for players new to collegiate quizbowl, or even quizbowl entirely.

The main introductory tournament in college quizbowl is ACF Fall. While some years the difficulty of ACF Fall has been slightly above the difficulty of a typical novice tournament, the 2017 and 2019 iterations are a good introduction to collegiate quizbowl for new players. All of the tournaments on this page are selected for teams to read to new players at practice, or for new players to read and learn from on their own.
