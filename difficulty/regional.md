Regional-difficulty tournaments are intended to distinguish teams trying to qualify for nationals. These tournaments assume that people playing them have at least a few tournaments' worth of quizbowl experience, and will likely be very difficult for someone who has just begun to learn things for collegiate quizbowl. However, players with some experience and who have put in the work will see it rewarded at regional-difficulty tournaments.

The main tournaments at this difficulty are the two national qualifiers, ACF Regionals and NAQT SCT. Another regular tournament that is often at about regional difficulty is Penn Bowl, written by the University of Pennsylvania team.

*Note: due to NAQT's packet-sharing limitations, past SCT questions are only available to teams that played the tournament, or that have purchased the questions from NAQT.*
